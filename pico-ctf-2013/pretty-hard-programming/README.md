## Write-up

Reading over the source code we find that we need to make the password variable equal to the secret key variable.
We also notice that the variables are extracted through our GET request. Changing the url to https://2013.picoctf.com/problems/php1/?password=fake&secret_key=fake#
give us the flag.

**Answer:** 
```Flag: php_means_youre_going_to_have_a_bad_time
