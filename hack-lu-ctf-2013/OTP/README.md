**Description:**

> Some robots are on the Oktoberfest and want to take some tasty oil in a tent. But they hadn't reserved a table and all tents are full. No one gets access. They found a back entrance and managed to spy the credentials while an employee enters. They captured the username “admin” and password “supersafepw”. But the employee also entered a strange number (168335). As they were sure nobody's looking, they tried the captured data to get in the tent, but it didn't work. Help the robots to get their tasty tasty oil. (Or they have to build their own tent with blackjack and hookers)
