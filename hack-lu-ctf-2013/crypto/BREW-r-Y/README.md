**Description:**

> Finally, the robots managed to sneak into one of our breweries. I guess I won't have to explain how bad that really is. That darn non-physical ones even shutdown our login system. Shiny thing, advanced technology, all based on fingerprints. Been secure as hell. If only it was running. Well, basically, we're screwed.
> But wait, there's hope. Seems like they didn't shutdown our old login system. Backward compatibility's a bitch, eh? Unfortunately, we got like _zero_ knowledge about the protocol. I mean come on, the last time we used that thingy was like decades ago. If we are lucky, the old authentication method is buggy.
> So, I heard you're kinda smart? Have a look at it. We desperately need to get drunk^W supply. You'll find the old system at ctf.fluxfingers.net:1335. Good luck.

> Hint: Data is - and is expected to be - compressed using zlib.
> Hint: The challenge text gives hints about the protocol involved. We updated it in order to reflect that fact.
